### Challenges

Having only recently picked up RESTful Routing, I found it difficult to set up the project in the correct way and using the API to display the relevant info seemed daunting. 

This project has helped me to grasp the fundamentals of REST and how to read documentation for API application.

### Improvements

There are quite a few aspects of the app I'd like to improve. 

Readability of code:
* Refactoring
* Namespacing

To my app:
* Make it fully respnsive for desktop and mobile. 
* Still needs a bit of CSS work on Login/Registration pages. 
* Display the date for each event on the MyEvents page. 
* Rather than making it an event managing website, transform it into a marketplace. Add event to basket rather than just 'MyEvents'. 
* Add FB oAuth Log-In
